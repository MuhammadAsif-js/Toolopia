          <span className="font-semibold text-primary">Welcome to Toolopia</span> – your go-to hub for smart, simple, and reliable online tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Founded by Israr Ijaz and Asif Arshad</span>, Toolopia was born from a simple idea: make powerful digital tools accessible to everyone without the complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe technology should save time, solve problems, and make life easier – not harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our journey started as two friends experimenting with ideas, but quickly grew into a mission: to build a platform where students, professionals, entrepreneurs, and everyday users can find tools that actually make a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          From productivity boosters to creative utilities, Toolopia is designed to be your all-in-one digital toolbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">What makes us different?</span> Simplicity, innovation, and trust. We don’t just create tools – we create experiences that empower people to achieve more with less effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every feature we add, every update we release, is built around one question: <span className="italic">“Will this genuinely help our users?”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">Our vision is big. 🚀</span> Toolopia aims to become one of the world’s most loved tool platforms – a place where millions of people come daily to get things done faster, smarter, and better.
        </p>
        <p>
          But no matter how much we grow, we’ll always stay true to our roots: building with passion, listening to our users, and keeping things simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toolopia isn’t just a website – it’s a community, and you’re a part of it. <span className="font-semibold">Together, we’re shaping a smarter digital future.</span>

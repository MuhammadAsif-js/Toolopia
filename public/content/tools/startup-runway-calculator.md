# Startup Runway Calculator Guide

Know exactly how long your startup can survive before running out of money.

## What Is a Startup Runway Calculator?

A **Startup Runway Calculator** helps you calculate your **runway period** â€” the number of months your startup can operate before exhausting its cash reserves.

It uses three main inputs:
- **Cash on hand**  
- **Monthly expenses**  
- **Monthly revenue**

### Formula
**Runway (months) = Total Cash Available Ã· Monthly Net Burn Rate**

Where:  
**Net Burn Rate = Expenses â€“ Revenue**

## Example: Quick Runway Calculation

If your startup has:  
- Cash = **$100,000**  
- Monthly expenses = **$20,000**  
- Monthly revenue = **$5,000**  

ðŸ‘‰ Net Burn Rate = $20,000 â€“ $5,000 = **$15,000**  
ðŸ‘‰ Runway = $100,000 Ã· $15,000 = **6.6 months**  

âœ… That means your startup can survive for roughly **6.6 months** before running out of money.

# Compound Interest Guide

Compound interest grows your investment by reinvesting earnings each period.

## Formula

**A = P (1 + r/n)^(n*t)**

Where:
- **P** = principal
- **r** = annual interest rate (decimal)
- **n** = compounding frequency per year
- **t** = years

## Tips

- Higher frequency slightly boosts returns.
- Long time horizons dominate small rate differences.
- Contributions (not modeled yet) often outweigh rate tweaks.

# Profit Margin & Break-Even Guide

Use these concepts to interpret the analyzer's output.

## Key Metrics

- **Profit Margin (%)** = Net Profit / Revenue * 100
- **Break-Even Units** = Fixed Costs / (Selling Price - Variable Cost)
- **Break-Even Revenue** = Break-Even Units * Selling Price

## Improving Margin

- Raise price (ensure value justification)
- Reduce variable cost via supplier negotiation or efficiency
- Spread fixed costs over higher volume

## Sensitivity Tips

Adjust one variable at a time to understand leverage:

- Price changes shift margin and break-even simultaneously.
- Fixed cost reductions only shift break-even.
- Variable cost efficiency can have outsized margin impact.
